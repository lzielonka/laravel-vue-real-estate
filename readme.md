# Real estate backendb

Develop a simple real estate application with Laravel and Vue.js. 

The task is separated into two subtasks.
- The first task is to create the admin panel where the user can filter and add a new real estate item. The app should be implemented with Vue.js on the frontend and Laravel on the backend. Points:
    - Listing the real estate entries (2 points)
    - Showing details of a real estate entry (2 points)
    - Filtering the real estate entries based on criteria (2 points)
    - Adding a new real estate entry that uses an API endpoint – see below (2 points)
    - Bonus task: Add validation to the form for adding new real estate entries  (2 points)
- The second task is to create an API backend which we will expose all the real estate data to other applications. We need these endpoints:
    - listing real estate entries with possibility to filter based on criteria – like in the UI (2 points)
    - listing countries (2 points)
    - listing developers (2 points)
    - adding a real esate entry (2 points)
    - retrieving details of a real estate entry (2 points)
- Please make an example cURL request or export a Postman/Insomnia collection so we're able to test the API
- Bonus task: write an integration test for a single API endpoint (2 points)

In total you can receive 22 points for completing this task.

**It's critical that you provide clear instructions on running the code, so we can test it. If that's at all different from the instructions below**

## Requirements

### Installing docker

[Instalation for mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/)

[Instalation for windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/)


### Database schema

![alt text](./database_schema.jpeg "Database schema")


### Running docker container

The default database configuration for running locally is already configured, so just run:

```shell
docker-compose up
```

After running the docker compose setup you should run the commands below to set up the project.

### Installing Composer packages

```
docker-compose exec app composer install
```

### Generating key and optimizing app
```
# needed for generating application app key 
docker-compose exec app php artisan key:generate
docker-compose exec app php artisan optimize
```

### Running laravel commands in docker
```
docker-compose exec app php artisan migrate
docker-compose exec app php artisan db:seed
```
### Running nodejs commands in docker
```
docker-compose exec app npm install
```
or
```
docker-compose exec app npm i -g yarn
docker-compose exec app yarn
```

### Set correct permisions if api router is not working
```
 docker-compose exec app chmod -R 755 storage
```

### Importing Postman collection

- Import included [Postman Collection](Real Estate.postman_collection.json)
- Change `BASE_URL` variable if needed (it's set to `localhost:8080`)

### Accessing the app

- Navigate to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) or configurated custom url
- Register or Login - if `db:seed` command has been run, you can login with `admin@admin.com` `admin123` credentials)
